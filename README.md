## App Idea: **FocusFlow**

FocusFlow is a productivity and wellness app designed to help users manage tasks while staying mentally refreshed. The app combines task management with mindful breaks, like short guided breathing exercises, ambient sounds, or quick stretches. Key features would include a smart task timer (like a Pomodoro mode), mood tracking, and customizable break suggestions based on stress levels.
